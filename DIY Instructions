Authors: Anushree and Anushka

What is our Project?
Our project is a cup that does not let you drink water. Everytime you try to drink water it splashes you in the face and then starts roasting you.

What did we use?
1. Arduino Uno R3: The brain of the project
2. Water Sensor: detects when the water level of the project decreases 
3. DF PlayerMini: Stores the roasts in the Microsd Card
4. Speaker: Plays the sound
5. Water pump: Pumps the water to splash the drinkers face
6. Straw: Helps direction the water 
7. Transistors: Acts as a switch for the water pump
8. Resistors
9. Jumper Wires
10. Breadboard

How does it work?
1. The person who is thirsty pics up the glass to drink water. As they start drinking water, the water sensor detects a change in the level of the water.
2. This change in the level of the water results in the trigerring of the DF Mini Player that contains the roasts.
3. This in turn results in the roasts being played through the speaker.
4. The change in water level also triggers the water pump that in turn using the transistor to turn on and splashes the person who tries to drink water.
5. This creates the project that doesnt allow people to drink water.
